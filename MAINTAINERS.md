- ownership of the PIC Model or the PIC Specification,
- normative authority over the PIC Model or the PIC Specification,

All such matters are defined **exclusively** in the PIC Specification
(see Appendix B).

- coordinate issues and documentation.

Maintainers MAY NOT:

- alter authorship or attribution,

## Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability

Maintainer status is **voluntary and operational only**.
